        <title>CRNC.work Agile Collaborative Methodology</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Making one’s professional contribution more valuable requires serious effort to listen, to make knowledge more relevant and to more genuinely network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;collaboration-does-not-just-happen-support-a-holarchic-self-organizing-self-empowering-team-takes-effort&quot;&gt;Collaboration does not just happen; support a holarchic, self-organizing, self-empowering team takes effort&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many teams fear taking chances. Fear prevents the ability to take risks, which dampens experimentation and potential is not be realized. We drive out fear by substituting leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;encourage-a-quality-driven-leadership-mindset-in-all-behaviors&quot;&gt;Encourage a quality-driven leadership mindset in ALL behaviors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture of collaborative leadership must be practiced and continually reinforced. Every aspect of execution matters. Quality leadership is not for sissies; collaborative thinking must be reflected in ALL practices, all processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lead-by-promoting-communication-collaboration-and-competition-among-team-members&quot;&gt;Lead by promoting communication, collaboration and competition among team members&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team members must be able to get along, to interact and challenge one another AND each team member must be capable of getting the team unstuck when the team gets stuck.  Get along and getting unstuck is about THINKING and trying to think differently in order to understand other points of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;motivate-and-energize-your-team-in-ways-that-channel-conflict&quot;&gt;Motivate and energize your team in ways that channel conflict&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing hard things is frustrating and inevitably leads to disagreements and conflict. It is necessary to use humor, teasing, practical jokes, dialogue and just getting out, giving things a try, traveling and actually doing different things to promote thinking differently … it’s not bad to have conflict; it’s bad to give up, hunker down, stick to old ways and blame others for the conflict [that is a result of frustration that will be encountered in doing serious, challenging hard research and development].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;work-with-large-national-or-even-globally-distributed-teams&quot;&gt;Work with large national or even globally distributed teams&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel is necessary. Proficiency in the digital realm is necessary. Thinking DIFFERENT is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;apply-workflow-as-code-discipline-and-practicing-agile-mechanics-just-to-get-practice&quot;&gt;Apply workflow-as-code discipline and practicing agile mechanics just to get practice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days, often in fact, it is important to just stay at it … to stick with a workflow, trying things and persevering … when professionals get in slumps, they work harder on the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workflow-as-code-sprints&quot;&gt;Workflow-As-Code Sprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All activities (design, code, integrate, test) are performed to create a one particular feature in one sprint.  We want sprints to be SMALL because with incremental additions to feature sets we can do a better job of ensuring that we have achieved a solid return on investment (ROI) delivered from each sprint … and if not, we can make adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workflow-as-code-kanban-techniques&quot;&gt;Workflow-As-Code kanban techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visualize the map … inbox, analyze, dev, test, crunch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Limit WIP … focus on the one big thing that matters most first&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manage flow … 5S WIP, shine, sort, simplify, standardize, sustain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make process explicit so that everyone sticks with the process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement feedback loops … standups, face-to-face, NOT meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evolve collaboratively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Making one’s professional contribution more valuable requires serious effort to listen, to make knowledge more relevant and to more genuinely NETWORK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;collaboration-does-not-just-happen-supporting-a-holarchic-self-organizing-self-empowering-team-takes-the-diligent-effort-of-an-aggressive-campaignhttpdictionaryreferencecombrowsecampaign&quot;&gt;Collaboration does not just happen; supporting a holarchic, self-organizing, self-empowering team takes the diligent effort of an aggressive &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/campaign&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaigning is about putting yourself out there and taking the chance that someone doesn’t like you. Fear prevents the ability to take risks, which dampens experimentation and potential is not be realized. We drive out fear by substituting leadership and that means STEPPING FORWARD in a meaningful way – that means applying business intelligence and finding the most appropriate battlegrounds for your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;encourage-a-quality-driven-leadership-mindset-in-all-behaviors-inhabit-the-mindset-of-leadership&quot;&gt;Encourage a quality-driven leadership mindset in ALL behaviors; inhabit the mindset of leadership&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture of collaborative leadership must be practiced mindfully and continually reinforced. Every aspect of execution matters. Quality leadership is not for sissies or people who resort to distractions, crutches and escapism when the going gets tough; collaborative thinking must be reflected in ALL practices, all processes, all logistics, all actions … nonstop, 24X7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lead-by-promoting-communication-collaboration-and-competition-among-team-members&quot;&gt;Lead by promoting communication, collaboration and competition among team members&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop wasting your time on people who will not help themselves. Team members must be able to get along, to interact and challenge one another AND each team member must be capable of getting the team unstuck when the team gets stuck.  Get along and getting unstuck is about THINKING and especially about trying to think differently in order to understand other points of view … it is important to work at understanding other points of view AND it also important to limit the time wasted on those who simply never try to understand others.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CRNC.work Research and Development!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;CRNC.work is about RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT … the priorities of this project at this point in time must happen in that order … development is primarily going to be financed and executed by individuals, collaborative thinking and research activities are something that can be done as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people&quot;&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything about training and coordination between anyone involved with the process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the process is performed and the specific requirements for doing it, such as policies, procedures, rules, regulations and laws&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;machines&quot;&gt;Machines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any equipment, computers, tools, etc. required to accomplish the job&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;materials&quot;&gt;Materials:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw materials, parts, pens, paper, etc. used to produce the final product&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;measurements&quot;&gt;Measurements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data generated from the process that are used to evaluate its quality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;environment&quot;&gt;Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions, such as location, time, temperature, and culture in which the process operates&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to CRNC.work!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One teensy little stealth project that I have been thinkering on involves building a better employment productivity toolchain or system architecture for professionals and firms that need talent …
Yeah, so it’s basically just vaporware now, but it’s about architecture and a protocol …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of something like Bitcoin attempting to build a better money protocol than the one built by the Federal Reserve … but CRNC.work is about skills and talent and social skills … finding a better social graph [than FB, Twitter. LinkedIn] and a better code graph than GitHub or StackExchange AND a better dating graph than eHarmony or AshleyMadison … and it’s about the actors owning their data rather giving up their data to a social network or hub or cheating site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all boils down to making people more productive or plugged into more productive work …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s basically about building a better resume data format … using a logic-less template for a deeper portfolio of skills, employment, education data that would basically be like an asset verified, validated, recommended by colleagues then folded and encrypted into a distributed, decentralized blockchain database … a virtual equity, of sorts – or really something that can be transformed into a asset thru executed contract or work … the resume equity object would in “in the market” seeking the highest and best use of human capital …. ready to be plugged into a smart contract for professional services … but only for the right situation.&lt;/p&gt;
