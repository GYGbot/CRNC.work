        <description>&lt;p&gt;Making one’s professional contribution more valuable requires serious effort to listen, to make knowledge more relevant and to more genuinely NETWORK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;collaboration-does-not-just-happen-supporting-a-holarchic-self-organizing-self-empowering-team-takes-the-diligent-effort-of-an-aggressive-campaignhttpdictionaryreferencecombrowsecampaign&quot;&gt;Collaboration does not just happen; supporting a holarchic, self-organizing, self-empowering team takes the diligent effort of an aggressive &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/campaign&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaigning is about putting yourself out there and taking the chance that someone doesn’t like you. Fear prevents the ability to take risks, which dampens experimentation and potential is not be realized. We drive out fear by substituting leadership and that means STEPPING FORWARD in a meaningful way – that means applying business intelligence and finding the most appropriate battlegrounds for your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;encourage-a-quality-driven-leadership-mindset-in-all-behaviors-inhabit-the-mindset-of-leadership&quot;&gt;Encourage a quality-driven leadership mindset in ALL behaviors; inhabit the mindset of leadership&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culture of collaborative leadership must be practiced mindfully and continually reinforced. Every aspect of execution matters. Quality leadership is not for sissies or people who resort to distractions, crutches and escapism when the going gets tough; collaborative thinking must be reflected in ALL practices, all processes, all logistics, all actions … nonstop, 24X7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lead-by-promoting-communication-collaboration-and-competition-among-team-members&quot;&gt;Lead by promoting communication, collaboration and competition among team members&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop wasting your time on people who will not help themselves. Team members must be able to get along, to interact and challenge one another AND each team member must be capable of getting the team unstuck when the team gets stuck.  Get along and getting unstuck is about THINKING and especially about trying to think differently in order to understand other points of view … it is important to work at understanding other points of view AND it also important to limit the time wasted on those who simply never try to understand others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;motivate-and-energize-your-team-in-ways-that-channel-conflict&quot;&gt;Motivate and energize your team in ways that channel conflict&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing hard things is frustrating and inevitably leads to disagreements and conflict. It is necessary to use humor, teasing, practical jokes, dialogue and just getting out, giving things a try, traveling and actually doing different things to promote thinking differently … it’s not bad to have conflict; it’s bad to give up, hunker down, stick to old ways and blame others for the conflict [that is a result of frustration that will be encountered in doing serious, challenging hard research and development].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;work-with-large-national-or-even-globally-distributed-teams&quot;&gt;Work with large national or even globally distributed teams&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel is necessary. Proficiency in the digital realm is necessary. Thinking DIFFERENT is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;apply-workflow-as-code-discipline-and-practicing-agile-mechanics-just-to-get-practice&quot;&gt;Apply workflow-as-code discipline and practicing agile mechanics just to get practice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days, often in fact, it is important to just stay at it … to stick with a workflow, trying things and persevering … when professionals get in slumps, they work harder on the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workflow-as-code-sprints&quot;&gt;Workflow-As-Code Sprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All activities (design, code, integrate, test) are performed to create a one particular feature in one sprint.  We want sprints to be SMALL because with incremental additions to feature sets we can do a better job of ensuring that we have achieved a solid return on investment (ROI) delivered from each sprint … and if not, we can make adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Visualize the map … inbox, analyze, dev, test, crunch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Limit WIP … focus on the one big thing that matters most first&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manage flow … 5S WIP, shine, sort, simplify, standardize, sustain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make process explicit so that everyone sticks with the process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement feedback loops … standups, face-to-face, NOT meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evolve collaboratively&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>GYGbot Research and Development!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;GYGbot is about RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT … the priorities of this project at this point in time must happen in that order … development is primarily going to be financed and executed by individuals, collaborative thinking and research activities are something that can be done as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people&quot;&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything about training and coordination between anyone involved with the process&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the process is performed and the specific requirements for doing it, such as policies, procedures, rules, regulations and laws&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;machines&quot;&gt;Machines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any equipment, computers, tools, etc. required to accomplish the job&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;materials&quot;&gt;Materials:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw materials, parts, pens, paper, etc. used to produce the final product&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;measurements&quot;&gt;Measurements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data generated from the process that are used to evaluate its quality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;environment&quot;&gt;Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions, such as location, time, temperature, and culture in which the process operates&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to GYGbot!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;GYGbot is about finding a higher and better use of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is would you like to improve? Are you into nutrition or health and fitness, do you especially enjoy a type of work? What weaknesses should you think about more? What your SMART objectives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering purely what information is available and KNOWN about your future career options, what are the pure absolute facts? What DON’T you know? What is most interesting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the intuitive or instinctive gut reactions or statements of emotional feeling that you have about work? What are the emotional drivers that have NOTHING to do with any hard justification, but just about intense feeling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What skeptical, critical-thinking and logic can be brought to bear and applied to identifying risks or reasons to be cautious, conservative and more aware of the business of producing products and serving clients?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we do a better job of thinking about the identification of brand new opportunities or new benefits that are not being taken advantage of? How can we better seek to promote a work atmosphere of happiness, peace, social harmony, warmth and love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we instigate, provoke, stimulate, investigate completely new research paradigms and original approaches. How can we brainstorm more effectively, more orthogonally just to see where a series of useful thoughts might go?  How do we break paradigms without destroying useful patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about these things as you interact with others who share your interests and passions … be a hub, BE MORE SOCIAL!&lt;/p&gt;
