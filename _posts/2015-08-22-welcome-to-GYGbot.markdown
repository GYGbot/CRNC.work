GYGbot is about finding a higher and better use of your time.

What is would you like to improve? Are you into nutrition or health and fitness, do you especially enjoy a type of work? What weaknesses should you think about more? What your SMART objectives?

Considering purely what information is available and KNOWN about your future career options, what are the pure absolute facts? What DON'T you know? What is most interesting?

What are the intuitive or instinctive gut reactions or statements of emotional feeling that you have about work? What are the emotional drivers that have NOTHING to do with any hard justification, but just about intense feeling?

What skeptical, critical-thinking and logic can be brought to bear and applied to identifying risks or reasons to be cautious, conservative and more aware of the business of producing products and serving clients?

How can we do a better job of thinking about the identification of brand new opportunities or new benefits that are not being taken advantage of? How can we better seek to promote a work atmosphere of happiness, peace, social harmony, warmth and love?

How can we instigate, provoke, stimulate, investigate completely new research paradigms and original approaches. How can we brainstorm more effectively, more orthogonally just to see where a series of useful thoughts might go?  How do we break paradigms without destroying useful patterns.

Think about these things as you interact with others who share your interests and passions ... be a hub, BE MORE SOCIAL!
