#Blockchain Background

## Other particularly noteworthy resources
The structure of this MOOC follows Table of Contents of extremely important and useful book [Blockchain](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/blockchain/9781491920480/) written by the Founder of [The Institute for Blockchain Studies](http://www.blockchainstudies.org/), [Melanie Swan](http://www.melanieswan.com/) and published by [O'Reilly Publishing](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/search/?q=Blockchain) in February, 2015.  

There are other noteworthy resources that are worth following closely as well ... for example, the [Ledra Capital Mega Master Blockchain List](http://ledracapital.com/blog/2014/3/11/bitcoin-series-24-the-mega-master-blockchain-list) and the [full Ledra Bitcoin series](http://ledracapital.com/blog/2013/12/28/the-ledra-bitcoin-series) are certainly a great starting point and complement to this MOOC.

If you are serious about your interest in learning more about the blockchain, the best way is do your own MOOC.  An easy way would be to fork the repository or just copy the [Markdown that generates this page](https://github.com/GYGbot/CRNC.work/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2015-08-30-CNRC.work-Blockchain-MOOC.markdown) on GitHub and then make yours better with your own curated content, notes, observations and updates.
