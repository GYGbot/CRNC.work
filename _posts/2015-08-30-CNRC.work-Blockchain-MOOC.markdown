In EVERY self-directed curriculum, the first thing that we need to address is our motivation or the "WHY DOES IT MATTER" of the topics we choose to learn about. Learning for the sake of curiosity or for accumulating esoteric knowledge is fine and dandy, of course ... but the point of focused, accelerated, productive learning is to expeditiously solve a problem or to efficiently develop more effective tools that enable others to better solve a problem ... as we learn about a topic, we should be thinking about each of the following headings and under each heading we should thinking about Strengths, Weaknesss, Opportunities and Threats.  In other words, the point of this accelerated learning is robust situational awareness of the terrain we face.

## People
Anything about training, management and coordination of effort between companies, locations, teams and anyone involved with a productive process.  How will the people involve be able to use what we want to build?

## Methods
How the process is performed and the specific requirements for defining the proper deliverables; this includes compliance with policies, procedures, reporting, rules, regulations and laws that are driven by other stakeholders in the process

## Machines
Any gear or equipment ... computational power, machine tools and tooling, automation, temporary fixtures and scaffolding, hardware, etc. required to accomplish the job

## Materials:
Raw materials, parts, pens, paper, power, fuel, lubricants, fasteners, hardware and other expendables will be used to produce the final product

## Measurements
What data are generated from the process and how will it be used to evaluate quality of the productive effort?  How accurately do the data depict reality?  What is the signal to noise ratio? What about measurement systems analysis or calibration of the recording device?

## Environment
The conditions, such as location, time, temperature, and political and social culture in which the process operates.  How will the environment fluctuate and change over time?  Can we design the process to be more antifragile, to benefit from more chaos or increased uncertainty?

#Blockchain Background

## Other particularly noteworthy resources
Any errors, inconsistencies or failures of the curated content can be blamed upon the individuals behind CRNC.work, but the STRUCTURE or OUTLINE of this MOOC is really solid ... because it was blatantly stolen from the Table of Contents of very important book Blockchain(https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/blockchain/9781491920480/) written by the Founder of [The Institute for Blockchain Studies](http://www.blockchainstudies.org/), [Melanie Swan](http://www.melanieswan.com/) and published by [O'Reilly Publishing](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/search/?q=Blockchain).  There are other noteworthy resources that are worth following closely as well ... for example, the [Ledra Capital Mega Master Blockchain List](http://ledracapital.com/blog/2014/3/11/bitcoin-series-24-the-mega-master-blockchain-list) and the [full Ledra Bitcoin series](http://ledracapital.com/blog/2013/12/28/the-ledra-bitcoin-series) are certainly a great starting point and complement to this MOOC. If you are interesting learning more about the blockchain, the best way might be to clone this MOOC and then make it better with your own curated content, notes, observations and updates.
