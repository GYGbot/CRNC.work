CRNC.work is one teensy, weensy itty-bitty little stealth project that a couple of us have been thinkering on ... it involves building a better employment productivity toolchain or system architecture for professionals and firms that need talent ...

Yeah, so it's basically just vaporware now, but it's about architecture and a protocol and laying a strong theoretical foundation that will sustain the work of development ... right now, CRNC.work is mostly about learning and constructing a [massively open online curriculum](http://gygbot.github.io/CRNC.work/MOOC/).

Think of something like Bitcoin attempting to build a better money protocol than the one built by the Federal Reserve ... but CRNC.work is about skills and talent and social skills ... finding a better social graph [than FB, Twitter. LinkedIn] and a better code graph than GitHub or StackExchange AND a better dating graph than eHarmony or AshleyMadison ... and it's about the actors owning their data rather giving up their data to a social network or hub or cheating site.

It all boils down to making people more productive or plugged into more productive work ...

It's basically about building a better resume data format ... using a logic-less template for a deeper portfolio of skills, employment, education data that would basically be like an asset verified, validated, recommended by colleagues then folded and encrypted into a distributed, decentralized blockchain database ... a virtual equity, of sorts -- or really something that can be transformed into a asset thru executed contract or work ... the resume equity object would in "in the market" seeking the highest and best use of human capital .... ready to be plugged into a smart contract for professional services ... but only for the right situation.
