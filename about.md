Get Your GYG is a recursive acronym.

GYGbot technology is about finding the highest and best use of one's time.

"Getting Your GYG" is simple enough in the most abstract since, but the devil is in the details ... and anyone who has ever sought employment has had some experience in confronting those difficult and challenging details. Managing a career and selling one's talents is probably the most important project that most people will ever handle.

"Getting Your GYG" is most certainly not an easy project to manage or one that people enjoy, i.e. the proof of that assertions is that the overwhelming majority of working age adults [who must provide for their own economic well-being] choose the relatively simple path of just getting and keeping a job, rather than finding looking for and finding new work everyday.

Managing professional or career gets tougher as the value of one's time increases but some portions of the project can be automated ...such as the maintenance of situational awareness and business intelligence necessary for security of professional reputations and improving value of skills, experience and knowledge.
