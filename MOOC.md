The CRNC.work project is based on the outrageous notion that the whole entire way that we think about employment, work and workflow should be more lean, agile, social, smart, secure, authenticated, revision-controlled, data-driven ... generating value through work should be like Bitcoin mining, except that the product of the effort is not a lottery where the chances are driven by computation speed, the product of REAL work should be almost 100% useful ... especially if we can do a better job of structuring smart contracts so that the objectives are truly SMART and so reward is a function of the quality of completed objectives.  In other words, if we want to re-invent the process of finding talent or finding employment, the FIRST task is to think about the architecture and management of workflow because the architecture depends upon smart executable contracts ... in other words, the reason that finding employment and employees is so tough is that owners and managers do not really know what they are doing when it comes to managing projects, defining objectives and communicating expectations.

In order to delve into this topic we are going to need to better understand several key topics including:

# [Blockchain](http://gygbot.github.io/CRNC.work/blockchain/mooc/2015/08/30/CNRC.work-Blockchain-MOOC.html)

# Brand, Reputation and Identity

# Culture

## Social Production

## Code of Conduct

# Git foundations and GitHub

# Problem-Solving

In EVERY self-directed curriculum, the first thing that we need to address is our motivation or the "WHY DOES IT MATTER" of the topics we choose to learn about. Learning for the sake of curiosity or for accumulating esoteric knowledge is fine and dandy, of course ... but the point of focused, accelerated, productive learning is to expeditiously solve a problem or to efficiently develop more effective tools that enable others to better solve a problem ... as we learn about a topic, we should be thinking about each of the following headings and under each heading we should thinking about Strengths, Weaknesss, Opportunities and Threats.  In other words, the point of this accelerated learning is robust situational awareness of the terrain we face.

## People
Anything about training, management and coordination of effort between companies, locations, teams and anyone involved with a productive process.  How will the people involve be able to use what we want to build?

## Methods
How the process is performed and the specific requirements for defining the proper deliverables; this includes compliance with policies, procedures, reporting, rules, regulations and laws that are driven by other stakeholders in the process

## Machines
Any gear or equipment ... computational power, machine tools and tooling, automation, temporary fixtures and scaffolding, hardware, etc. required to accomplish the job

## Materials:
Raw materials, parts, pens, paper, power, fuel, lubricants, fasteners, hardware and other expendables will be used to produce the final product

## Measurements
What data are generated from the process and how will it be used to evaluate quality of the productive effort?  How accurately do the data depict reality?  What is the signal to noise ratio? What about measurement systems analysis or calibration of the recording device?

## Environment
The conditions, such as location, time, temperature, and political and social culture in which the process operates.  How will the environment fluctuate and change over time?  Can we design the process to be more antifragile, to benefit from more chaos or increased uncertainty?

# Security

# Smart contracts
