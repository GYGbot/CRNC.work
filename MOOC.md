The CRNC.work project is based on the outrageous notion that the whole entire way that we think about employment, work and workflow should be more lean, agile, social, smart, secure, authenticated, revision-controlled, data-driven ... generating value through work should be like Bitcoin mining, except that the product of the effort is not a lottery where the chances are driven by computation speed, the product of REAL work should be almost 100% useful ... especially if we can do a better job of structuring smart contracts so that the objectives are truly SMART and so reward is a function of the quality of completed objectives.  In other words, if we want to re-invent the process of finding talent or finding employment, the FIRST task is to think about the architecture and management of workflow because the architecture depends upon smart executable contracts ... in other words, the reason that finding employment and employees is so tough is that owners and managers do not really know what they are doing when it comes to managing projects, defining objectives and communicating expectations.

In order to delve into this topic we are going to need to better understand several key topics including blockchain, security, identity, reputation, smart contracts, git foundations, github, social production, culture of freedom and responsibility.
